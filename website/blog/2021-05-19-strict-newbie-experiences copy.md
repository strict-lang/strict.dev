Last month we had some new people starting to work [Strict](https://github.com/strict-lang/), but sadly after a few weeks progress came back to a halt. We got a new tokenizer and a clearer vision which parts are next and most important (IDE, VM), however the new people are doing their own thing again. Progress is much slower again, I am still super busy with growing the team, and AI projects. There will be a few months of training and getting the new guys on the AI projects up to speed, but hopefully after I will have more time on myself to continue on the next important parts of Strict.

I noticed even with compiler and programming language experts it was still hard to get the functionality, syntax and vision across. In the beginning everyone was hyped, but once the hard problems come up to solve we need longevity to finish the parts up and when the vision is not in everyones head, it gets hard. So my main focus is to write a functional prototype start to finish (which was what was planned anyway). Maybe a minimum viable product is possible now to get all the parts working (language parsing, running code, IDE experience, SCrunch, etc.) and then even play around with the AI generating some of this code. I am thinking 8 kyu/7 kyu <a href="https://codewars.com">CodeWars</a> level, basic kind of problems, hello world, loops, simple state machines, some conversion of arrays and lists. A huge part is string manipulation and lists/collections/queries/etc. which is probably best left out in this first prototype iteration.

Once that works, I will show it to some programmers and see what they think and if it clicks easier than the current iteration of ideas. And maybe focus more on hiring, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2586567652/">C# Compiler Job position is still open</a> in the meantime.
