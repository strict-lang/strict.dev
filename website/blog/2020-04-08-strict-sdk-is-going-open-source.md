Strict was always supposed to be open source, Merlin pushed a bit to get some parts released. Upcoming work is to write the low level language framework (apps, io, logs, math, files, etc.) and to allow anyone writing any code, the strict compiler needs to be out there as well, so we decided to release the https://github.com/strict-lang/sdk finally on github (the compiler is currenty all written in go and can't bootstrap itself yet).

I also ran a logo contest last month and we created some basic graphics for the website, ide, libraries, file types, etc. Kirsten still wants to do some mascot work when she finds time and we are still all adding more stuff to the https://strict.dev/docs/Overview
