We didn't have much time to work on the website, the language changed quite a lot into a more functional style, while still being fully declarative and test driven. The IntelliJ IDE is still being worked on and once that is finished the language will go into a much more useable state and we can let it lose on some employees.

Roadmap:

- Feb 2020: IntelliJ IDE up and running with our own parser/lexer
- Mar 2020: SCrunch working to make writing TDD code even more fun
- Apr 2020: Work on backends should be mostly completed
- May 2020: Work on Stricti can start
- Jun 2020: Ongoing work on .silk packages and the standard libraries
