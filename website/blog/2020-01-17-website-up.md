After trying out https://jekyllrb.com/ and many themes and plugins after checking out the even more complex https://gohugo.io/ it turns out these are not good fits for the Strict language, which should be easy to install and work immediately. https://docusaurus.io/en/ is a project that is installed with one line and works instantly after downloading all the dependencies automatically, on any platform that supports node.

Well, not much on here yet, we will add documentation over time and get more speed on the road in 2020.
