We didn't have much time to work on the website, the language changed quite a lot into a more functional style, while still being fully declarative and test driven. The IntelliJ IDE is still being worked on and once that is finished the language will go into a much more useable state and we can let it lose on some employees.

Originally I wanted to post a roadmap, but since we don't really have a development team working on this and I pretty much do this in my spare time plus getting some help here and there, development speed is still slow. The current focus is getting IntelliJ IDE up and running with our own parser/lexer in the upcomming months. Write small hello worlds in the console is fine, but for any productive work an IDE is needed imo. My exployees at Delta Engine are also my guinea pigs for Strict and without ReSharper and NCrunch we just ain't gonna get happy.

So next up is adding SCrunch working to make writing TDD code even more fun, after that work on backends (C#, C++, Java) should be completed and finally work on Stricti can start (which is the basic idea letting AI Neural Networks try to generate some simple code based on the user just writing tests for the code to be generated).
