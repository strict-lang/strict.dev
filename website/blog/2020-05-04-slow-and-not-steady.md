The corona pandemic didn't affect us much, but we did do home office work for most employees away from the Delta Engine company since mid March, for some employees things worked out great, for others it wasn't a very productive time. Also talking about ideas and just putting stuff up on whiteboards just works much better in person. Things are back to normal now and the AI and robot hardware work is heating up at the office ^^

Sadly progress on the Strict IntelliJ plugin is very slow and Merlin, who did a lot of the early work recently and was leading the IntelliJ platform sdk work, is stepping back a bit. I will try to find a replacement and try to finish the IntelliJ plugin work. We didn't have much time to work on the website, the language changed quite a lot into a more functional style, while still being fully declarative and test driven. The IntelliJ IDE is still being worked on and once that is finished the language will go into a much more useable state and we can let it lose on some employees.
